  <P>
    介紹傳值傳參考<br>
    基礎型別傳值，物件型別傳參考<br>
    傳參考若想COPY但不影響原物件<br>
    方法1 Array.prototype.slice() 回傳一個新陣列物件，為原陣列選擇之 begin 至 end（不含 end）部分的淺拷貝<br>
    方法2 Array.prototype.concat() 合併兩個或多個陣列<br>
    方法3 const team4 = [...players];淺拷貝<br>
    方法4 const team5 = Array.from(players); 新陣列物件<br>
    方法5 const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); JSON轉兩次，深拷貝<br>

  </P>

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
